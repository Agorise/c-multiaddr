STATUS:
Compatibility: Windows/Mac/Linux/Openbsd based systems (probably more)
-Finished Base58.h Encryption/Decryption Algorhytm
-Finished Endian.h Library for automating compiling for Linux/Mac/Windows
-Finished Varhexutils - Different conversion algorhytms between bytes and strings etc.
-Finsihed Varint.h - Conversion from Hex
-Finished Protocols.h - Library for loading protocols & manipulating them easily.
What needs to be done (known so far):

-Not finished: protoutils.h (performs final byte encodings and checks for validity

-Not started: Multiaddr.h 
(The actual thing that makes everything simple, encapsulating different protocols easily for lower 
internet consumption and higher overall efficiency.) (Basically simulating classes from other languages for easy development)

Other things to do: 
Add conversion for bigendian machines (doubt anyone will actually need them tbh but portability was requested.)
Should work on all platforms so far.
Add proper documentation in case anyone needs to add protocols etc.

So far it's almost finished.

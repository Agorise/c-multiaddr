Compatibility: Windows/Mac/Linux/Openbsd based systems (probably more)
-Finished Base58.h Encryption/Decryption Algorhytm
-Finished Endian.h Library for automating compiling for Linux/Mac/Windows
-Finished Varhexutils - Different conversion algorhytms between bytes and strings etc.
-Finsihed Varint.h - Conversion from Hex
-Finished Protocols.h - Library for loading protocols & manipulating them easily.
-Finished: Multiaddr.h 
(The actual thing that makes everything simple, encapsulating different protocols easily for lower 
internet consumption and higher overall efficiency.) (Basically simulating classes from other languages for easy development)
-Almost finished: protoutils.h

Halted & Under investigation:
====================================
-Varhexutils: Memory Error analysis
-Protoutils : Memory Error analysis
====================================
I'd  apreciate some help on this one!

Things that need to be implemented:
Protocols, everything except IP4,TCP,UDP,IPFS.
